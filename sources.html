    <h3>Sources</h3>
    <p lang="en-us">
        This page is dedicated to all of the sources that I used in order to make this website the way that it is. 
        This includes various textbooks and other aspects from which I learned these various skills.

    <h4>HTML Sources</h4>
    <p lang="en-us">
        The first source used, as well as one of the most important sources that I used was W3Schools and their
        How-to tutorial about creating a Top Nav bar on the top of the screen.
        This source was used in order to create the very beautiful navigation bar at the top of the screen. 
        This website provides a short tutorial about how to set up the Top Nav bar, including providing helpful 
        examples and source code in case you should get stuck.

    </p>

    <p lang="en-us">
        The second source used is a textbook, one written by Jon Duckett. This textbook was used in order to create all of those 
        borders on the images, as well as all of those nice little lines (horizontal rules) that separate information on the screen. These concepts 
        were introduced to me through this book, as well as many other interesting tidbits of information about the beautiful coding
        language that is HTML. If you have any desire to learn how to build a website, this textbook definetly is useful and provides
        a lot of colorful images and examples in order to set you on the right path.

        This source was also form W3Schools, but this time I utilized their website that teaches people about
        how borders work in HTML. I utilized this in order to have a small catalogue of possible borders to use
        just in case I needed them. They are currently stored in the CSS sheet. They should be useful just in
        case I would want to have fancy borders around words. Like <product>this</product>, for example.

      Another source I used from w3schools was their article about the parrallax scroll. I wanted to implement
      that into our website as that would give it some cool flair that not all websites have. I included a photo of
      Mr. Hall of <product>Mr. Hall's Fidget Emporium</product> as the image that is being scrolled past.
